# Disclaimer

This book is still at a Work in Progress stage.

## Motivation

The idea behind this book is not to talk about how to deploy and scale, but about the process of building the app. Why? Lots of blog posts and books talk about putting apps in production. Very few talks about working on building these apps. This is why I choose to talk about the process, workflow, and tools we use at ThinkR when building big Shiny Apps.

So, to sum up, we'll not talk about what to do when the app is ready, we'll talk about how to make it ready.
