## Git

Friends don't let friends work on a coding project without version control. 

### what is git ?

git is a software that quickly proves to be essential when building an application, or any other project, with a minimum of ambition. it allows you to :

+ version his code
+ work collaboratively
+ save your code on a dedicated server

Any changes in the code must be tracked and documented, we must be able to know who did what and when, and why. 


If you are not familiar with git, don't be afraid and the little constraint proposed by the use of this tool is largely compensated by the gains made.

Git can be used in different ways and different approaches exist. The comprehensiveness of the different possible approaches is beyond the scope of this book, and other resources exist as well. We invite you to follow these different links:

### commit - push - pull

Without going deeper, please note that:
you will make commit (which corresponds to changes you want to freeze),
that each commit is documented ( example: "adding the graph in the analysis tab of the application", or "fixing the docx export bug").

A set of commit, can then be sent to the server, it is a Push. Your collaborators will then be able to recover your modifications by making a sweater (and vice versa)

the commit - push - pull trio corresponds to the tools of git's daily life.

### Branch

In practice, we use the notion of branch to organize our work and ideas ( or to avoid stepping on our feet between collaborators).
The main branch is called the master, ideally you never work directly in it, and this branch should always contain a functional, displayable version of the application.
The dev branches correspond to work areas in which we try to fix bugs or add features to the application. The modifications made in these dev branches will then be transferred (directly or indirectly) to the master branch ( or release-candidate)

in concrete terms, a developer addressing the resolution of a problem will produce a new branch specific to the result of that problem

### Issue

Tools like github or gitlab allow to follow issues (bug or feature to be done), to organize these tasks in a kanban, with due dates etc.. These issues can be associated with commits so that these issues can be discussed between collaborator and beta tester/sponsor. Having such a platform is a considerable gain in the
productivity. And everything is centralized there

Git integrates very well with the Rstudio IDE, so, while you develop using git can be as simple as clicking a button from time to time. (a commit button, a pull button and a push button)

The use of git is not reserved for applications that can be written with more than two hands, and from a person to use git is a good idea and is part of good practice.


Developing a shiny application is above all developing an application. Whatever the language of the tools dedicated to it exist, git is actually part of it. And just because it's about R, doesn't mean you shouldn't use these tools.

## CI and testing

Testing is central for making your application survive in the long run. 
The {testthat} package can be used to test the "business logic" side of your app, while the application features can be tested with packages like {shinytest}, or software like Katalon.
