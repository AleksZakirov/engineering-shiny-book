# Step by step {#stepbystep}

## Step 1: Design  

Don’t rush into coding. I know you want to, because it’s what we like to do and what we are good at. But before entering the coding marathon, take time to think about the application and the way it will be deployed and used. Take a pen and a piece of paper and draw the app. Talk about it with the people who will use the app, just to decipher what they actually need. Take a moment to talk with the IT team. Here are some example questions you can ask:

+ “Who are the end users of the app?” — This will help you know if the end users are tech literate or not, and what they aim to achieve with the app.
+ “How frequently will they use the app?” — The details of the design & the UI of the app you use every day is more crucial than when the app is used once a month.
+ “What level of complexity and personalization do the users really need?” — People writing app specifications sometimes want more functionality than what is actually needed by the users.
+ “What level of interactivity do you want, and to what extent is it central?” — People love interactive graphs and like when things automatically sync with each other. Yet these two can make the app slower, without any significant gain. For example, being reactive to a `selectInput()` or a `sliderInput()` can lead to too much computation: maybe the user will not succeed to choose the right input the first, second or third time… So let them do their choice, and add a button.
+ “How important is it that the app is fast?” — Should you spend a lot of time optimizing the little things?
+ etc.

Asking questions, taking notes, and drawing the app help you have a good idea of what is expected and what you have to do now.

## Step 2: Prototype 

I like to go “UI first”. For two main reasons:

Once the UI is set, there is no “surprise implementation”. Once we agree on what elements there are in the app, there is no sudden “oh the app needs to do that now”.
A pre-defined UI allows every person involved in the coding to know which part of the app they are working on. In other words, when you start working on the backend, it’s much easier to work on a piece you can visually identify and integrate in a complete app scenario.
So yes, spend time writing a front-end prototype in lorem ipsum. And good news, we’ve got a tool for you: it’s called {shinipsum}. The main goal of this package is to create random Shiny elements that can be used to draw a UI, without actually doing any heavy lifting in the backend.

Hence, once you’ve got a draft of your app on a piece of paper, you can then move to the “ipsum-UI” stage: building the front-end of the app, and filling it with random Shiny elements, with functions like `random_ggplot()` or `random_DT()`.

Another package that can be used to do that is `{fakir}`. This package is designed to create fake data frames, primarily for teaching purposes, but it can also be used for inserting data into a shiny prototype.

## Step 3: Build

Now the UI and the features are set, time to work on the backend 🎉

This part is pretty standard — everybody can now work on the implementation of the functions that process the app inputs, in their own modules. As the UI, functionalities and modules have been defined in the previous steps, everyone (well, in theory) knows what they have to work on.

And also, as said before, there should be no “surprise implementation”, as the app has been well defined before.

## Step 4: Secure

Securing your app means two things: testing, and locking the application environment.

So first, be sure to include tests all along the building process — just like any other R code. As the app is contained in a package, you can use standard testing tools for testing the business logic of your app — as said in the first part, it’s important to split the backend functions and algorithm from the user interface. That means that these backend functions can run outside of the application. And yes, if they can run outside of the app, they can be tested the standard way, using {testthat}.

When it comes to testing the front end, you can try the {shinytest} package from RStudio, if you need to be sure there is no visual regression all along the project development. {shinyloadtest}, on the other hand, tests how an application behaves when one, two, three, twenty, one hundred users connect to the app, and gives you a visual report about the connection and response time of each session.

One other tool I like to use is Katalon Studio. It’s not R related, and can be used with any kind of web app. How it works is quite simple: it opens your browser where the Shiny app runs, and record everything that happens. Once you stop the recording, you can relaunch the app and it will replay all the events it has recorded. And of course, you can specify your own scenario, define your own events, etc. It’s not that straightforward to use, but once you get a good grasp of how it works, it’s a very powerful tool.

Secondly, secure your app means that it can be deployed again any time in the future — in other words, you have to ensure you’ve got a proper handle on the required R version, and of the package versions which are required to run your app. That means that you have to be aware that upgrading a package might break your app — so, provide an environment that can prevent your app from breaking when a package gets updated. For that, there is, of course, Docker, R specific tools like `{packrat}`, or deploying custom CRAN repositories or package manager.

## Step 5: Deploy

Tools for deployment are not the subject of this blog post so I won’t talk about this in detail (remember, we are talking about building 😉 ), but our two tools of choice are Docker & ShinyProxy, and RStudio Connect.
