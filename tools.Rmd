# Tools {#tooling}

## Package

Shiny Apps are to be put into a package. Why? Because it allows them to be documented, tested, and installed in different environments. 

## Git

Friends don't let friends work on a coding project without version control. 

## Shiny modules

Shiny modules are crucial tools when it comes to building big shiny apps: they allow to collaborate, to split the work into pieces, they facilitate testing, and they allow implementation of new features to be made more easily. 

## {shinipsum} and {fakir}:

## CI and testing

Testing is central for making your application survive in the long run. The {testthat} package can be used to test the "business logic" side of your app, while the application features can be tested with packages like {shinytest}, or software like Katalon. 

## Deploy

Docker, Shiny Proxy, RStudio Connect... Don't just put your app on the server and let it live. Use tools that are specifically designed for deploying and scaling web applications.
