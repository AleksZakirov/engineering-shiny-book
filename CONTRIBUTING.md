## Building

### Build the book locally with existing cache

This requires Docker, Node and multiple dependencies installed using {renv}.
By default, this will use the cache to restore outputs.

*hexmake*
```sh
docker pull colinfay/hexmake
```

*minifyr*
```sh
sudo apt-get -y install curl 
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github("colinfay/minifyr")' 
Rscript -e 'remotes::install_cran("cicerone")' 
# Verify it works
Rscript -e 'library(minifyr);
        minifyr_npm_install(TRUE);
        minify_package_js("cicerone", minifyr_js_uglify)'
```

Then you can build it in a Terminal
```sh
Rscript prep.R
Rscript -e 'bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")'
Rscript -e 'browseURL("_site/index.html")'
```

### Update the list of dependencies in DESCRIPTION

```sh
Rscript -e 'source("before-build.R")'
```

### Update versions of packages in {renv}

```sh
Rscript -e 'renv::snapshot()'
```

### Recreate datasets

Run the content of 'render_all.R'
