# About Successful Shiny Apps {#successfulshinyapp}

If you're reading this page, chances are you already know what a Shiny App is — a web application that communicates with R, built in R, and working with R. 
Almost anybody can create a prototype for a small data product in a matter of hours. 
And no knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript is required, making it really easy to use — you can rapidly create a POC. 
But what to do now you want to build a complex Shiny App?
