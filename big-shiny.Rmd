# About Successful Shiny Apps {#successfulshinyapp}

If you're reading this page, chances are you already know what a Shiny App is — a web application that communicates with R, built in R, and working with R. 
The beauty of `{shiny}` is that it makes it easy for anybody to create a small app in a matter of hours.  
With small and simple Shiny apps, no knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript is required, which makes it really easy to use — you can rapidly create a POC for a data-product and showcase an algorithm or present your results with an elegant, simple to build user interface.

## What's a complex Shiny App? 

> Complex software is harder to think about, harder to test, harder to debug, and harder to maintain — and above all, harder to learn and use.

### Reaching the cliff of complexity

Things are quite simple when it comes to small prototypes or proof of concepts. 
But things change when your application reaches "the cliff of complexity"^[
We borrow this term from Charity Major, as heard in _Test in Production with Charity Majors_, [CoRecursive](https://corecursive.com/019-test-in-production-with-charity-majors/)]{target="_blank"}.


But what do we mean by complexity? 
Getting a clear definition is not an easy task^[
Ironic right?
]
as it very depends on who is concerned and who you're talking to.
But let's try to come with a definition that will serve us in the context of engineering Shiny applications. 
When building software, we can think of complexity from two points of view: the complexity as it is seen by the coder, and the complexity as it is seen by the customer / end user
^[from _The Art of Unix Programming_, "Chapter 13: Speaking of Complexity"].

> With great complexity comes great responsibility

When your program reaches this state, there is a lot of potential for failure, be it from a developer or user perspective. For the code, bugs are harder to anticipate: it's hard to think about all the different paths the software can follow and difficult to detect bugs because they are deeply nested in the numerous routines the app is doing. 
It's also hard to think about what the state of your app is at a given moment in time because of the numerous inputs and outputs your app contains. 
From the user perspective, the more complex an app, the more steep the learning curve is, which means that the user will have to invest more time learning how the app works, and will be even more disappointed if ever they realize this time has been a waste. 

#### Two views of complexity

+ From the developer point of view

An app is to be considered complex when it is big enough in terms of size and functionality that it makes it impossible to reason about it at once, and you must rely on tools to understand and handle this complexity.
This type of complexity is called _implementation complexity_. 
One of the goal of this book is to present you a methodology and toolkit that will help you reduce this form of complexity. 

For example, we'll talk about a design / prototype / build / secure / deploy framework, which helps you reduce the complexity of implementing and maintaining new app features. 

We'll also be talking at length about the `{golem}` package, which provides a toolkit for reducing the cognitive load of handling complexity in large Shiny applications. 
For example, creating a new Shiny module requires following a very strict structure. 
One way to do that is to remember how to do that and to code it from scratch (a method which has an important cognitive load and is very error prone). 
Another way is to copy and paste an existing module and to adapt it, which is, as any copy and paste, likely to lead to errors. 
Or there is the `{golem}` way, in which you rely on a robust tool to build the foundations for a new module.

Another benefit of adopting automation for common application components is that it ensures that you're following a convention. 
And conventions are crucial when it comes to building and maintaining complex systems: by imposing a formalized structure for a piece of code, it enhances readability, lessens the learning curve, and lightens the chance for typos and/or copy and paste errors. 

+  Customers and users

On the other hand, customers and end users see complexity as _interface complexity_. 
Interface complexity can be driven by a lot of elements. 
For example, the probability of making an error while using the app, difficulty understanding the logical progression in the the app, the presence of unfamiliar behavior or terms, visual distractions...
This book will give you a strategy to help you cope with the need for simplification when it comes to designing user interfaces. 

#### Balancing complexities

There is an inherent tension between these two types of complexity. Designing an app means finding a good balance between implementation and interface complexity. 
Reducing implementation complexity means one has to make some decisions that will lower one while rising the other. 

For example, we can think of something very common in Shiny: the "too much reactivity" pattern. 
In some cases, coders try to make everything reactive: e.g., three sliders and a selectInput, all updating a single plot.
This behavior lowers the interface complexity: users don't have to think a lot about what they are doing, they just move things around and it updates. 
But this kind of pattern can make the app compute too many things: users rarely go to the slider value they need on their first try. They usually miss what they actually want to select in an input. 
So, way more computation for R. 
One solution can be to delay reactivity or to cache things so that R computes fewer things. 
But that comes with a cost: handling delayed reactivity and caching elements increases implementation complexity. 
One other solution is simply to add a button after the input, and only update the plot when the user clicks on it. 
This pattern makes it easier to control reactivity from an implementation side. 
But it can make the interface a little bit more complex for the user who have to perform another action in addition to changing their inputs.  

We'll argue somewhere else in the book that not enough reactivity is better than too much reactivity, as the latter increases computation time, and relies on the assumption that the user makes the right action on the first try.
Another good example is `{shiny}`'s `dateRangeInput()` function, which takes a start which is posterior to the end (which is the behavior of the JavaScript plugin used in `{shiny}` to create this input). 
Handling this special case is doable: with a little bit of craft, you can watch what the user inputs and throw an error if the start is after the end
^[see [shiny/issues/2043#issuecomment-525640738](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/2043#issuecomment-525640738){target="_blank"} for an example].
That solution augments the implementation complexity, while leaving it as is requires the user to think about whether or not the starting date is before the ending date, thus increasing the interface complexity.

_-> Insert here something of the like: "It's up to you to think about what's the best balance between these two sources." _

### Assessing complexity

How can we get a good overview of this complexity? 

#### Codebase size

Another measure that sometimes comes in the discussion is the codebase size. 
It's relatively hard to use this number of lines metric, as R is very permissive when it comes to indentation and line breaks, and (unlike JavaScript or CSS), it is generally not minified^[
The minification process is the process of removing all blank characters and put everything on one line so that the file in the output is much smaller.
].  
It also depends on your coding style and the packages you're using. 
For example, [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} packages encourage the use of the pipe (`%>%`)
^[
"_`%>%` should always have a space before it, and should usually be followed by a new line._", [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) 
] 
with one function by line, producing more lines in the end code.

Consider this piece of valid R code:

```{r}
iris[
  1
  :
    5, 
  c
  (
    "Species"
  )
  ]
```


9 lines of code for something that could also be written in one line.  

```{r}
iris[1:5, c("Species")]
```

In other words, using this kind of writing style can make the code base larger in term of lines, without really adding complexity to the general program. 

Another drawback of this metric is that it focuses on numbers instead of readability, and in the long run, yes, readability matters
^["Pressure to keep the codebase size down by using extremely dense and complicated implementation techniques can cause a cascade of implementation complexity in the system, leading to an un-debuggable mess.", from _The Art of Unix Programming_, "Chapter 13: Speaking of Complexity"]. 

Still, this metric can be useful to reinforce what you've learned from other metrics: it's rather unlikely that you'll find this "extreme" coding style we've just showed, and even if it might not make sense to compare two code base that just differ by 1 or 2 % of lines of code, it's very likely that a code base which is ten, twenty, one hundred times larger is a more complex software. 
Also, another good sign related to this metric is the number of files in the project: R developers tend to split their functions into several files, so the more files you'll find in a project, the more large the code base is. 
Numerous files can also be a sign of maintainance complexity: it's harder to reason about an app logic splitted into several files than about something that fits into one linear code inside one file. 

If you want to use this metric, you can do it straight from R with the `{cloc}` package, available at https://github.com/hrbrmstr/cloc.

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("hrbrmstr/cloc")
```

For example, let's compare a rather big package (`{shiny}`) with a small one (`{attempt}`):

```{r}
library(cloc)
library(dplyr)
shiny_cloc <- cloc_cran("shiny", .progress = FALSE)
attempt_cloc <- cloc_cran("attempt", .progress = FALSE)
clocs <- bind_rows(
  shiny_cloc, 
  attempt_cloc
)

# Counting lines of code
clocs %>%
  group_by(pkg) %>%
  summarise(
    loc = sum(loc)
  )

# Counting files
clocs %>%
  group_by(pkg) %>%
  summarise(
    files = sum(file_count)
  )

```

Here, just from these two metrics, we can safely assume that `{shiny}` is a more complex package than `{attempt}`.

### Production Grade Software Engineering

Complexity is still frowned upon by a lot of developers, notably because it has been seen as something to avoid according to the Unix philosophy. 
But there are dozens of reasons why an app can become complex: for example, the question your app is answering is quite complicated and involves a lot of computation and routines. The resulting app is rather ambitious and implements a lot of features, etc.
So yes, there is a chance that if you're reading this page, you're working or are planning to work on a complex Shiny app. 
And this is not necessarily a bad thing! 
Shiny apps can definitely be used to implement production-grade
^[By production-grade, we mean a software that can be used in a context where people use it for doing their job, and where failures or bugs have real-life consequences] 
software, but production-grade software implies production-grade software engineering. 
To make your project a success, you need to use tools that reduce the complexity of your app and ensure that your app is resilient to aging. 

In other words, production-grade Shiny apps require working with a software engineering mindset, which is not always an easy task in the R world. 
R comes from the land of the academics and is still used as an "experimentation tool", where production quality is one of the least concerns. 
Many developers in the R world have learned R as a tool for making statistics, not as a tool for building software.
These contexts are very different and require different mindsets, skills, and tools. 

With `{shiny}`, as we said before, it's quite easy to prototype a simple app, without any "hardcore" software engineering skills. 
And when we're happy with our little proof of concept, we're tempted to add something new. 
And another. 
And another. 
And without any structured methodology, we're almost certain to reach the cliff of complexity very soon and end up with a code base that is hardly (if ever) ready to be refactored to be sent to production. 

The good news is that building a complex app with R (or with any other language) is not an impossible task. 
But it requires planning, rigor, and correct engineering.   
This is what this book is about: how to organise your Shiny App in a way that is time and code efficient, and how to use correct engineering to make your app a success.

## What's a successful Shiny App? 

The good news is that your application does not have to be complex to be successful.
Even more, in a world where "less is more", the more you can reduce your application complexity, the more you'll be prepared for success. 

So what's a successful Shiny app? 
Defining such a metric is not an easy a task, but we can extract some common patterns when it comes to applications that would be considered successful. 

### It exists

First of all, an app is successful if it was delivered.
In other words, the developer team was able to move from specification to implementation to testing to delivering. 
This is a very engineering-oriented definition of success, but it's a pragmatic one: an app that never reaches the state of usability is not a successful app, as something along the way has blocked the process of finishing the code. 

This implies a lot of things: but mostly it implies that the team was able to organise itself in an efficient way, so that they were able to work together in making the project a success. 
And anybody that has already worked on a code base as a team knows it's not an easy task.

### It's accurate

The app was delivered, and it answers the question it is supposed to answer, or serves the purpose it is supposed to serve. 
Delivering is not the only thing to keep in mind: you can deliver a working app but it might not work in the way it is supposed to work.

Just as before, accuracy means that between the moment the idea appears in someone's mind and the moment the app is actually ready to be used, everybody was able to work together toward a common goal.

### It's usable

The app was delivered, it answers the question it is supposed to answer, and it is user-friendly. 
Unless you're coding for the sake of the art, there will always be one or more end users. 
And if these people can't use the app because it's too hard to use, too hard to understand, because it's too slow or there is no inherent logic in how the user experience is designed, then it's inappropriate to call the app is a success. 

### It's immortal

Of course that's a little bit far fetched, but when designing the app, you should set the ground for robustness in time and aim at a (theoretical) immortality of the app. 

Planning for the future is a very important component of a successful Shiny App project.
Once the app is out, it's successful if it can exist in the long run, with all the hazards that implies: new package versions that potentially break the code base, implementation of new features in the global interface, changing key features of the UI or the back-end, and not to mention passing the code base along to someone who has not worked on the first version, and who is now in charge of developing the next version. 
And this, again, is hard to do without effective planning and efficient engineering. 
In fact, this new person might simply be you, a month from now. 
And _"You'll be there in the future too, maintaining code you may have half forgotten under the press of more recent projects. When you design for the future, the sanity you save may be your own._^[_The Art of Unix Programming_, Eric Steven Raymond]
