# Don't rush into coding {#step-design}

## Designing before coding

> You have to believe that software design is a craft worth all the intelligence, creativity, and passion you can muster. Otherwise you won't look past the easy, stereotyped ways of approaching design and implementation; __you'll rush into coding when you should be thinking__. You'll carelessly complicate when you should be relentlessly simplifying — and then you'll wonder why your code bloats and debugging is so hard.

### The Urge to Code 

At the moment you receive the specifications for your app, it's tempting to rush into coding.
And that's perfectly normal: we're Shiny developer because we love building softwares, so as soon as a problem emerges, our brain starts thinking about technical implementation, packages, pieces of code, and all these things that we love to do when we're building an app.

Rushing into coding from the very beginning is not the safest way to go. 
Focusing on technical details from the very beginning can make you miss the big picture, be it for the whole app if you're in charge of the project, or for the piece of the whole app you've been assigned to. 
Have you ever faced a situation in a coding project where you tell yourself "Oh, I wish I had realised this sooner, because now I need to refactor a lot of my code for this specific thing"? 
Yes, we all have been in this situation: realising too late that the thing we've implemented doesn't work with another feature we discover along the road. 
And what about "Oh I wish I had realised sooner that this package existed before trying to implement my own fonctions to do that!.
Yes, same thing: we're jumping straight into solving programming problem when someone else has open-sourced a solution to this very same problem. 
Of course, implementing your own solution might be a good thing in specific cases: avoiding heavy dependencies, incompatible licensing, the joy of intellectual challenge... 
But when building production softwares, it's safer to go for an existing solution if it exists and fits in the project: existing packages / software benefit from wider testing, wider documentation, and a larger audience if you need to ask questions.

So, before rushing into coding, take some time to conceptualise your application / module on a piece of paper. 
That will help you get the big picture for the piece of code you'll be writing: what are the inputs, what are the outputs, what packages / services you can use inside your application, how it will fit in the rest of the project.

### About Concept Map

## Ask questions

// TODO

Take a pen and a piece of paper and draw the app. 
Talk about it with the people who will use the app, just to decipher what they actually need. 
Take a moment to talk with the IT. Here are some questions you can ask:

+ “Who are the end users of the app?” — This will help you know if the end users are tech literate or not, and what they aim to achieve with the app.
+ “How frequently will they use the app?” — The small details of the design & the UI of an app you use on a daily basis is more crucial than when the app is used once a month.
+ “What level of complexity and personalization do the users really need?” — People writing app specifications sometimes want more functionalities than what is actually needed by the users.
+ “What level of interactivity do you want, and to what extent is it central?” — People love interactive graphs and like when things automatically sync with each other. Yet these two can make the app slower, without any significant gain. For example, being reactive to a `selectInput()` or a `sliderInput()` can lead to too much computation: maybe the user will not succeed to choose the right input the first, second or third time… So let them do their choice, and add a button so that they can validate when they are ready.
+ “How important is it that the app is fast?” — Should you spend a lot of time optimizing the little things?
+ etc.

Asking questions, taking notes, and drawing the app help you have a good idea of what is expected and what you have to do now.

So, next step!
