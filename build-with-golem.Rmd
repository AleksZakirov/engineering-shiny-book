## Package

We believe that Shiny Apps are to be put into a package. 
Why? Because it allows them to be documented, tested, and can be installed in several environments.

Also, think about your last Shiny app that wasn’t in a package. 
It’s an `app.R`, maybe with a folder you’re sourcing and which contains functions (let’s say in a` R/` folder). 
Maybe you’ve written some meta information (let’s call it a `DESCRIPTION`), and some tests you’ve put in a `tests/` folder. 
Also, as you want to be sure to do the things right, you’ve put documentation in your functions. 
Do you see where I’m heading? 
Yes, you’ve written an R package.


## Shiny modules

Shiny modules are crucial tools when it comes to building large-scale shiny apps: they allow to collaborate, to split the work into pieces, they facilitate testing, and they allow implementation of new features to be made more easily.
