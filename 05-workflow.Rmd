# The workflow {#workflow}

Building a robust, production-ready web application will be made easier by following a given workflow. 
The one we are advocating for is divided in five steps: Design, Prototype, Build, Strenghten and Deploy. 
In this section, we will give an overview of the different steps of this workflow: the rest of the book will cover in more depth each of these steps. 

## Part 1: Design 

The first part of the workflow is the __design__ part. 
This first step of the process is the one that happens, before actually writing any line of code. 

This first step is not Shiny nor R specific, but something software engineers do for any software or web application: discuss with the clients, the end-users, and the developers who will work on the project. 

During the process of designing, you will define how the application will be build: somewhere between users' dreams, what is technically possible, and the time you have to build the application.  

## Part 2: Prototype 

The _Prototype_ part is the one during which you will build the front-end and the back-end, but separately.

As you may know, a Shiny application is an interface (the front-end) used to communicate information to the end-users that are computed on the server side (the back-end). 

To start on solid ground, you need to build the two (front and back) seperately: 

+ On one hand, work on the general appearance, without working on any actual algorithmic implementation: position of the inputs and outputs, general design, interactions.... everything that does not rely on computation on the back end. 
This "UI first" approach will be made possible for Shiny with notably one package, `{shinipsum}` [@R-shinipsum], and tools like basic CSS, and some `{golem}` [@R-golem] functions.

+ On the other hand, you (or someone from your team), will be working on building the back-end logic, which are the actual outputs that are going to be displayed, the algorithm that will compute results, and all the elements that do not need an interactive runtime to work. 
For this point, you can use what we call a "Rmd-first" approach, by combining R functions with the writing of Vignettes that describes the internal of the application. 

## Part 3: Build 

The _Build_ part is the one where you will combine the business (or back-end) logic with the front-end. 
In this third part, you will work on the core engine of the application, making the business logic work inside the interactive logic of your application. 

## Part 4: Strengthen 

_Strengthening_ your app is ensuring your application is immortal, in the sense that we defined in the first chapter of this book.

In this part, we will go through unit tests, reproducible development environment, version control and continuous integration in the context of Shiny applications.

## Part 5: Deploy 

To _Deploy_ is to send your application into production once it is built.

Being exhaustive here would be an impossible task: there are countless ways to make your application accessible to its targeted users, but we will try to cover some basics about this part. 

In this part, we will quickly present a series of methods to deploy your application on various environments, notably sharing your application as a package, sending it to an RStudio platform, or building a Docker image to serve your app on a cloud provider.
