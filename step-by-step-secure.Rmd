Strengthening your app means two things: testing, and locking the application environment.

## Testing your app

### Testing the business logic

If you have been following the good practices we have listed in previous chapters, your current application has at least these two properties: 

+ The business-logic functions are separated from your interactive-logic functions.
+ Your application is inside a package.

On top of being a sane organization approach, using this separation inside a package structure allows to leverage all the tooling that has been built for testing "standard" packages. 

R developers have been developing packages for a long time, and at the time of writing these lines (February 2020), more than 15,000 packages are available on CRAN. 
To sustain these developments, a lot of tooling has been created to secure the development process, and especially in the field of creating unit tests for your package.

Unit tests are a general concept in software engineering that describes the process of writing a form of assessment of your code validity. 
A simplified explanation is that if you write a function call `meaning_of_life` that returns `42`, you will expect this function to always return `42`, and to be alerted if ever this value changes. 
Using unit tests is a way to secure your work in the future, be it from future you or from collaborator: if anyone comes and change the code behind `meaning_of_life` so that the result is no longer `42`, the developer working on this piece of code will be able to catch it. 

There are several packages in R that can be used to implement unit testing, and you can even implement your own tests. 
One of the most popular right now^[
Based on the number of Reverse dependencies & suggests at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html
] is [`{testthat}`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/), by Hadley Wickham.
This testing framework lets you write a series of tests and expectations, which are then launch when calling `devtools::test()`, either locally or in you CI system. 

``` r
test_that("The meaning of life is 42", {
  expect_equal(
    meaning_of_life(), 
    42
  )
})
```

When it comes to testing the front end, you can try the {shinytest} package from RStudio, if you need to be sure there is no visual regression all along the project development. 
{shinyloadtest}, on the other hand, tests how an application behaves when one, two, three, twenty, one hundred users connect to the app, and gives you a visual report about the connection and response time of each session.

One other tool I like to use is Katalon Studio. 
It’s not R related, and can be used with any kind of web app. 
How it works is quite simple: it opens your browser where the Shiny app runs, and record everything that happens. 
Once you stop the recording, you can relaunch the app and it will replay all the events it has recorded. 
And of course, you can specify your own scenario, define your own events, etc. 
It’s not that straightforward to use, but once you get a good grasp of how it works, it’s a very powerful tool.

## A reproducible environment

Secondly, secure your app means that it can be deployed again any time in the future — in other words, you have to ensure you’ve got a proper handle on the required R version, and of the package versions which are required to run your app. 
That means that you have to be aware that upgrading a package might break your app — so, provide an environment that can prevent your app from breaking when a package gets updated. 
For that, there is, of course, Docker, R specific tools like `{packrat}` or `{renv}`, or deploying custom CRAN repositories or package manager.
