# The workflow {#workflow}

This book divides the workflow of building big Shiny apps in five parts: Design, Prototype, Build, Secure and Deploy.  

## Part 1: Design 

To _Design_ is to participate to the conception of the application. 
This part comes before any line of code. 
As for any software or web application, there will be discussions between the end-users, the bakers and the developpers. 
In this part, we will propose some tools to help define the goal of the application and find a compromise between users' dreams, technical issues and time allocated to the development.  

## Part 2: Prototype 

To _Prototype_ is to define a visual proposition for the application. 
A Shiny application is a visual interface to communicate with end users. 
The general appearance, position of the different inputs and outputs as well as graphical interactions need to be chosen with care. 
In this part, we will propose the 'UI-first' method with tools to focus on the bodyshell of the app before engineering the engine.  
The visual proposition also concerns graphs and tables that will really appear in the application.
Prototyping outputs based on a selection of possible workflows of the future application is easier in a context without interactivity.
The 'Rmd first' method comes handy to focus on the core of the application, develop functions and documentation of the package along with visual propositions on example data.  

## Part 3: Build 

To _Build_ is to develop the engine of the application. 
Bulding a robust Shiny application requires to use the correct development tools.
In this part, we will propose to develop using [{golem}](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/), a package especially created to help design a robust and maintainable Shiny application inside a R package.

## Part 4: Secure 

To _Secure_ is to ensure your application will long last.
Some good practices will help during the development of the application.
In this part, we will go through unit tests, reproducible development environment, version control and continuous integration applied to Shiny applications.

## Part 5: Deploy 

To _Deploy_ is to put your application in production.
There are multiple ways to present your application to its targeted public. 
In this part, we will quickly present methods to deploy your application and show how {golem} can help you in this task.
